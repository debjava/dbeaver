        <h1>Additional Connection Settings</h1>
        <p>This is last page of connection wizard and it contains properties common for all drivers.</p>
        <p>These properties are used by DBeaver, not by drivers.</p>

        <table border="1">
            <tr valign="top">
                <td nowrap>Connection Name</td>
                <td>Name of connection. This will be used by the <a href="../views/database-navigator.html">database navigator</a>.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr valign="top">
                <td nowrap>Save password locally</td>
                <td>Check this field if you want to store database password locally. Otherwise DBeaver will ask for a password each time you connect to this database.
                    Passwords are stored in encrypted form, but if you use highly secured databases it is possible that a third person could access your computer. We recommend avoiding this feature.

                <td nowrap>Show system objects</td>
                <td>Check this if you want to see database system objects (schemas, tables, etc). If you don't check this then system objects will be hidden.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr valign="top">
                <td nowrap>Filter catalogs/schemas</td>
                <td>Show only catalogs (schemas) where the name matches a specific pattern. Pattern format may be specific to each database but generally it uses the LIKE syntax.</td>
