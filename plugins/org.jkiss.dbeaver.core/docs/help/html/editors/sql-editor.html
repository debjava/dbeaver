<h1>SQL Editor</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>SQL editor allows editing and execution of SQL queries and scripts.</p>
<p>There are two ways to open SQL editor - using "SQL Editor" or "New SQL Editor" commands. These commands are accessible through main toolbar or main menu or with shortcuts CTRL+L and CTRL+ALT+L.</p>
<p>"SQL Editor" command opens recent SQL script for currently active connection (active connection name shown in main toolbar) or creates new SQL script (which can be opened later from <a href="../views/project-explorer.html">Project Explorer</a> view). "New SQL Editor" always creates new script.</p>
<p>When you close SQL editor it will be auto-saved. If you want to revert changes - use appropriate command from context menu.</p>
<p>SQL editor highlights SQL syntax which structure (keywords) depends on current database SQL dialect. When you open SQL editor for some connection DBeaver will try to connect to underlying database. If database is inaccessible then you won't be able to execute queries.</p>
<p>You may change active database of current SQL editor at any moment using main toolbar.</p>
<p>There are two SQL execution modes: query and script.</p>

<h2>Query execution</h2>
<p>Query execution command accessible from toolbar, context menu, main menu or with shortcut CTRL+Enter.</p>
<p>SQL editor extract current query - it is SQL statement under cursor limited by empty lines or statement delimiter (";" symbol)</p>
<p>Also you may select any part of text - it will be executed as single query.</p>
<p>Query execution usually produces some result set - it will be printed in "Data Grid" tab. Read more about <a href="result-set.html">Result Sets</a> navigation and edit.</p>

<h2>Scripts execution</h2>
<p>Script is a whole content of SQL editor or selected text. This command is accessible from menu, toolbar or with shortcut ALT+X.</p>
<p>SQL editor parses content using ";" character as delimiter between separate statements and then executes these statements consequently.</p>

<h2>Execution plan</h2>
<p>You may automatically build execution plan for current query. This command accessible from toolbar or with shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+Enter.</p>
<p>Driver provider must support execution plan extraction. Generic driver provider doesn't support this feature.</p>

<h2>Execution log</h2>
<p>Execution log tab contains history of all command executed in current SQL editor.</p>
