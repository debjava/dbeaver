<h1>Additional Connection Settings</h1>
<p>This is last page of connection wizard and it contains properties common for all drivers.</p>
<p>These properties are used by DBeaver itself, not by drivers.</p>

<table border="1">
    <tr valign="top">
        <td nowrap>Connection Name</td>
        <td>Name of connection. It will be used in <a href="../views/database-navigator.html">database navigator</a>.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
        <td nowrap>Save password locally</td>
        <td>Check this field if you want to store database password locally. Otherwise DBeaver will ask password each time you connect to this database.
            Passwords are stored in encrypted form, but if you use highly secured databases and it is possible that third person can access your computer we recommend to avoid this feature.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
        <td nowrap>Show system objects</td>
        <td>Check if you want to see database system objects (schemas, tables, etc). If not checked then system objects will be hidden.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
        <td nowrap>Filter catalogs/schemas</td>
        <td>Show only catalogs (schemas) which name matches this pattern. Pattern format may be specific to each database but generally it has LIKE syntax.</td>
    </tr>
