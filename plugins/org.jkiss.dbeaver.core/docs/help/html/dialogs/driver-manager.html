<h1>Driver Manager</h1>

<p>
    Driver is a third-party library which provides ability to work with certain database engine.
    Most drivers in DBeaver are JDBC (Java-Database-Connectivity) drivers provided by database vendors.
    Driver manager dialog allows you to create, delete and <a href="driver-editor.html">edit</a> driver descriptions.
</p>
<p>
    In driver manager dialog you may see drivers "tree".
    Elements in top level are "Driver providers". Driver provider is a DBeaver plugin.
    Usually driver providers are designed for some particular database engine, for example MySQL.
    There is one exception - "Generic" provider which allows to work with any database using it's JDBC driver.
    Generic providers do not "knows" anything about particular databases, their specific features, metadata structure, etc. It provides very basic interface.
</p>
<p>
    User may edit only "managable" drivers. All drivers under "Generic" provider are managable.
    Particular database drivers are usually not managable and user can't change their settings.
</p>
<p>
    DBeaver shipped with many predefined drivers.
    User may create any number of additional drivers.
