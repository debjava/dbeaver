<h1>Frequently Asked Questions about DBeaver</h1>

<h2>General</h2>
<h3>Why "DBeaver"?</h3>
<p>DBeaver named in contrast to SQuirreL, popular java-based database client.
It's like "database beaver against SQL squirrel".
Also I just like these animals :)
<!--We hope that beaver will be much stronger, faster and smarter than squirrel :)--></p>

<h3>Who makes it and for what reason?</h3>
<p>Check <a href="">Team</a> page to see who we are.</p>
<p>For now there is no any certain goal of this project. We just want to make a good (better than ony other) universal tool to work with databases.</p>
<p>This is a completely non-commercial project, nobody pays us for the job, there are no donations or any other kind of funding. This project is powered by our pleasure for 100%.</p>
<p>So far.</p>

<h3>May I access DBeaver source code?</h3>
<p>Not yet. At the moment DBeaver is completely freeware but it is not opensource.</p>

<h2>Installing and running</h2>
<h3>DBeaver doesn't start</h3>
<p>A1: You have old Java or not Java VM installed. DBeaver require Java 1.6. If you have different versions of JVM on your computer then you may
specify particular one in command line (see readme file about command line arguments).</p>
<p>A2: You use wrong DBeaver version (e.g. 64bit on 32bit OS)</p>

<h3>Database driver not found</h3>
