The '''DBeaver''' is a universal database administration tool and SQL client. It uses [[JDBC]] to allow users to explore and interact with databases via a JDBC driver.  It provides an editor that offers code completion and syntax highlighting for standard [[SQL]].  It also provides a plugin architecture that allows plugin writers to modify much of the application's behavior to provide database-specific functionality or features that are database-independent. As this desktop application is written entirely in [[Java platform|Java]] with [[Swing (Java)|Swing]] UI components, it should run on any platform that has a [[JVM]].<ref name="squirrel-faq">{{cite web|url=http://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.net/paper/SQuirreL_us.pdf|title=SQuirreL, a Universal SQL Client|first=Gerd|last=Wagner|first2=Glenn|last2=Griffin|accessdate=2009-04-15}}</ref>

DBeaver is freeware but it is not open-source. According to it's licence it can be used for any purpose with no limitations.

==Feature Summary==

* Object Tree allows for browsing database objects such as catalogs, schemas, tables, triggers, views, sequences, procedures, UDTs, etc.
* The SQL Editor is based on RSyntaxTextArea by fifesoft.com to provide syntax highlighting.  It can be used to open, create, save and execute files containing SQL statements.
* Supports simultaneous sessions with multiple databases. This allows to compare data and share SQL statements between databases. <ref>{{cite web|last=Martinig|first=Franco |title=SQuirreL SQL Client|url=http://www.methodsandtools.com/tools/tools.php?squirrel| accessdate = 1 March 2011}}</ref>
* It runs on any platform that has a JVM.
* Plugin architecture to facilitate database vendor-specific extensions (Information or actions not available using standard JDBC - see [[SQuirreL SQL Client Plugin API]] for more details)
