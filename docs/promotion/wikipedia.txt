The '''DBeaver''' is a universal database administration tool and SQL client.
Generally it uses [[JDBC]] drivers to allow users to work with databases.
It provides an SQL editor that offers code completion and syntax highlighting for standard [[SQL]] and database metadata browser which allows to view database structure and settings.
Also it has a set of tools and plugins which allows to view/edit ER diagrams, perform export and import of tables and databases, etc.
DBeaver has a plugin architecture that allows to create custom plugins for certain databases to provide non-standard database features (like tablespaces, stored procedures, security management, etc).
As DBeaver is written entirely in [[Java platform|Java]] with [[SWT (Java)|SWT]] UI components, it should run on any platform that has a [[JVM]].

DBeaver is freeware but not open-source. According to it's licence it can be used for any purpose with no limitations.
