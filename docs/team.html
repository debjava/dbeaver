<h1>DBeaver Team</h1>

<p>At the moment I have not so much to say.</p>
<p>
Author, architect, main developer, UI designer, tester, sysadmin, webmaster, etc - Serge Rieder. It's me.
Contact me by email (<a href="mailto:serge@jkiss.org">serge@jkiss.org</a>) or by skype (<a href="skype:serge.rider">serge.rider</a>).
</p>
<p>Also there are people who have helped me in many ways. These are my colleagues and friends:<br/>
Eugene Fradkin - alpha-testing, some ideas in UI and a lot of discussions about software development in general during business lunches :)<br/>
Andrey Sukhanov - testing on Unix platforms and assistance in web hosting.<br/>
</p>

<p>So, the team is really tiny for now. Obviously team size will increase as the project will grow. If you want to join or if you have any suggestions for the project - please contact me.</p>
<br/>
<p>Thanks for using DBeaver,<br/>Serge</p>
